## To-Do List


  
- This is a command-line To-Do List application that helps you prioritize tasks by categorizing them based on **urgency and importance**.
- This time management method was proposed in *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* by Stephen Covey:
![Time Management Matrix](data/timeManagementMatrix.png)
- Stephen Covey proposes that the best way to prioritize tasks is by the order of the quadrant: Q1, Q2, Q3, and lastly Q4
- The To-Do List is ordered in the same way. There is also a **"what's next"** option that displays your next task by this priority
- You can also add **tags** to your tasks, such as University, Work, Grocery, etc. and there is an option to display your tasks categorized by tag
- You can add **due dates** to tasks. You can then see today's tasks or this week's tasks
- This project is of interest to me because I want to manage my time better by using it more efficiently. This tool can help me or anyone with managing time better.
